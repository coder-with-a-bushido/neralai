![Neralai Architecture](./client/static/neralai_architecture.png)

## How does it work?

1. A WHIP client sends media to Neralai using the WHIP endpoint `/stream`.
2. The media is forwarded to `ffmpeg` for processing; HLS files are generated.
3. Once the stream starts, the playlist file can be accessed by any HLS player from the endpoint `/stream/{resourceId}/hls/stream.m3u8`.
4. The stream can be stopped with a DELETE call to `/stream/{resourceId}`, as supported by WHIP clients.

## Running

Clone the repo and run the command

```sh
go run main.go
```

The server will run on port 8080 by default. Now, open the `client/` directory and run it for demo.
